Smart crossover algorithms

Getting Started with the Problem
================================

Check out the paper [From an Interior Point to a Corner Point: Smart Crossover](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09420/). 
This package is designed based on the above paper.


Structure of the Code
=====================
There are two major algorithms included:
the network crossover methods in 
`smart_crossover.network_methods` and perturbation crossover
methods in `smart_crossover.lp_methods`.

The problem types that can be solved are listed in `smart-crossover.format`.
